How to run our code

    To run our code you need following libraries (*) 
        ligntning
        nltk
        numpy
        scipy
        scikit-learn (>=0.13)
    You could use pip to install them. 
        pip install -U numpy scipy nltk scikit-learn
        pip install -U https://github.com/mblondel/lightning/archive/master.zip

	To run the newsgroups test:
		python ogroup_test_3ng.py	

	To run the synthetic data test:
		python newimplgroup_syn.py


* We implemented the core algorithm by ourselves. The 'ligntning' lib is for the result comparison.
